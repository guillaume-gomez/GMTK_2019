# Roboto
![cover.png](cover.png)

This game was made in 48 hours for the [GMTK game jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019).
This year, the theme is "only one", we wanted the game to reflect this theme in its mechanics.

Play Roboto, a puzzle platformer where you control Roboto, an obsolete robot, that tries to escape a factory to avoid being recycled. 
Unfortunately, Roboto is very damaged and can move only one time in each direction before its propellers breaks.
Use sparingly each of its propellers to help him escape from this hell!
Each move matter
